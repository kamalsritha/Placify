# PlaceX

In the contemporary educational landscape, the role of technology in streamlining administrative 
processes within academic institutions has become increasingly indispensable. Recognizing this 
necessity, we present PlaceX, an innovative Placement Management System meticulously crafted 
using the MERN stack. Aimed at revolutionizing the conventional practices of placement 
management within colleges, PlaceX serves as a comprehensive solution designed specifically for 
the exigencies of Placement Departments. Overview PlaceX embodies two integral modules: the 
User Module and the Admin Module, each catering to distinct user personas while harmoniously 
facilitating the seamless orchestration of placement-related activities. Through the User Module, 
students gain access to a sophisticated platform where they can register their academic credentials, 
explore opportunities presented by recruiting companies, track their application progress, and even 
share insights through an interview experience repository. Conversely, the Admin Module 
empowers placement officers with robust tools for managing student data, orchestrating 
recruitment drives, and overseeing the placement process with precision. At the heart of PlaceX 
lies a comprehensive array of technologies and libraries meticulously integrated to ensure optimal 
performance and functionality. The backend API is developed using Node.js, while data storage 
and management are handled by MongoDB, a versatile NoSQL database. Authentication and 
authorization are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing a secure mechanism 
for user validation. To enhance security further, bcrypt is employed for password hashing, ensuring 
the protection of sensitive user data. Node mailer facilitates seamless communication by enabling 
the system to send emails to users, keeping them informed about important updates and 
notifications. Additionally, Express.js serves as a middleware, facilitating the handling of HTTP 
requests and routes, while cookie-parser helps maintain user sessions effectively.
